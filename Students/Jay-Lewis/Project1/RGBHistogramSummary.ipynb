    "* Ultimately this method seems mediocre. I was hoping that by maintaining the RGB values instead of converting to grayscale better performance could be achieved.\n",
    "* This method works well for computer generated images which are dominated by a few colors, thus it is more limiting than other methods.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* This image is dominated by the light blue color within the background. For this reason, it was an extreme case which could not be correctly classified\n"
